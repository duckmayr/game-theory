## Why Game Theory?

. . .

::: {.block}
### George E.P. Box
All models are wrong, but some are useful
:::

. . .

- Like all models, simplified representation to gain insight
- Formal language for strategic interactions
- Robust predictions about human behavior?
- **Caveat!** Like all models, only as good as the appropriateness of the assumptions

## Decision Theoretic Models

A decision problem is a triple $(A, X, \succsim)$, where

- $A$ is a set of actions available to the decision maker,
- $X$ is a set of outcomes, and
- $\succsim$ is a preference relation over outcomes.

## Preferences

- Preference relation:
  + Weak preference relation, $x \succsim y$ ("$x$ is at least as good as $y$")
  + Strict preference relation, $x \succ y$, ("$x$ is better than $y$")
  + Indifference relation, $x \sim y$

## Rationality

- A decision maker's preferences are *rational* if and only if their preferences are *complete* and *transitive*
  + Completeness: A preference relation $\succsim$ is complete if and only if for any $x$ and $y$ in $X$, $x \succsim y$ or $y \succsim x$; that is, for any two outcomes in $X$, the decision maker can tell you which they (weakly) prefer
  + Transitivity: A preference relation $\succsim$ is transitive if and only if for any $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $X$, if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$, then $x \succsim z$
- A decision maker is considered rational if they have rational preferences and choose the best action according to their preferences
- **Note** that this does **not** mean the decision maker's preferences have to be qualitatively "rational" or "self-interested"

## Examples of Rational and Irrational Preferences

- Quinn prefers blue houses to grey houses, prefers white houses to blue houses, and prefers white houses to grey houses
- Riley prefers playing baseball to playing basketball, prefers playing chess to playing baseball, and prefers playing basketball to playing chess
- Casey cares about both their own income as well as the income of their friend Jude.
  + Consider three outcomes:
    - A: \textcolor<9-10>{Blue}{Casey makes \$55,000 and Jude makes \$45,000}
    - B: \textcolor<11>{Blue}{\textcolor<9>{DarkGreen}{Casey makes \$100,000 and Jude makes \$50,000}}
    - C: \textcolor<10-11>{DarkGreen}{Casey makes \$50,000 and Jude makes \$100,000}
  + Casey \textcolor<9>{BurntOrange}{prefers B to A}, \textcolor<10>{BurntOrange}{prefers C to A}, and \textcolor<11>{BurntOrange}{prefers C to B}

## Payoff or utility functions

- Sometimes it can be convenient to *represent* a player's preferences by a *payoff function*
  + Associates a number with every possible outcome
  + Higher numbers are preferred
- Example: Pat prefers apples to oranges, prefers bananas to apples, and prefers bananas to oranges.
  + The payoff function $u$ where $u(\text{orange}) = 1$, $u(\text{apple}) = 2$, and $u(\text{banana}) = 3$ represents Pat's preferences
  + A payoff function $v$ where $v(\text{orange}) = 1$, $v(\text{apple}) = 10$, and $v(\text{banana}) = 100$ would also represent Pat's preferences
