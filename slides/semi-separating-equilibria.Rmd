## The Algorithmâ„¢

You can find semi-separating equilibria in a signaling game with 2 types and mixed strategies with a "simple" 3-step algorithm:

. . .

1. Determine what player 2 must do to make one (or more) type(s) of player 1 mix
2. Determine how player 1 must mix to induce the strategy from step 1
3. Ensure consistency of beliefs and sequential rationality for the resulting strategy profile

## Example (Setup)

\only<2-8>{
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item<2-> Nature chooses the state of the world
    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item<3-> It is $x$ with probability $\pi < 1/2$
    \item<4-> It is $y$ with probability $1 - \pi$
    \end{itemize}
\item<5-> An avisor $A$ learns the state of the world and tells a decision maker $D$ to take either action $X$ or action $Y$
\item<6-> $D$ then chooses to take action $X$ or action $Y$
\item<7-> $D$ receives payoff of 1 if the action matches the state (e.g. $X$ and $x$) or 0 otherwise
\item<8-> $A$ receives a payoff of 1 if $X$ is chosen and 0 if $Y$ is chosen, regardless of the state, but also bears a cost $c > 0$ if they give incorrect advice
\end{itemize}

## Example (Step 1)

Step 1: Determine what player 2 must do to make one (or more) type(s) of player 1 mix

. . .

- First notice that $A$ and $D$'s interests are aligned when the state is $x$
- So we should try to induce mixing for the $y$ type of $A$
- $A$'s expected utility of saying $X$ is best when the state is $y$ is $p - c$
- $A$'s expected utility of saying $Y$ is best when the state is $y$ is $q$
- So $A$ can mix if $q = p - c$

## Example (Step 2)

Step 2: Determine how player 1 must mix to induce the strategy from step 1

\only<1-7>{
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item<1-> If $A$ mixes, both of $D$'s information sets are reached with positive probability
    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item<2-> Assuming $A$ always says $X$ is best when the state is $x$, then $A$ only says $Y$ is best when the state is $Y$, so $\mu = 0$
    \item<3-> But both types sometimes say $X$ is best, so $\lambda = \frac{\pi r}{\pi r + (1 - \pi) s}$
    \end{itemize}
\item<4-> So at the bottom information set, $D$ chooses $Y$ for sure ($q = 0$)
\item<5-> This means $p$ must equal $c$ (since $A$ can only mix if $q = p - c$)
\item<6-> $D$'s expected utility of choosing $X$ if $A$ says $X$ is best is $1\lambda + (1 - \lambda) 0 = \lambda$
\item<7-> $D$'s expected utility of choosing $Y$ if $A$ says $Y$ is best is $0\lambda + 1(1 - \lambda) = 1 - \lambda$
\end{itemize}
}

\only<8->{
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item<8-> So $D$ can mix if $\lambda = 1/2$, and since $r$ will be 1, $A$ must set $s$ according to:

\begin{align*}
\lambda & = \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{\pi r}{\pi r + (1 - \pi)s} & = \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{2\pi}{\pi + (1 - \pi)s} & = 1 \\
2\pi & = \pi + \left( 1 - \pi \right) s \\
\pi & = \left( 1 - \pi \right) s \\
\frac{\pi}{1 - \pi} & = s
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
}

## Example (Step 3)

Step 3: Ensure consistency of beliefs and sequential rationality for the resulting strategy profile

. . .

- We worked out consistency of beliefs in Step 2
  + $\mu = 0, \lambda = \frac{\pi r}{\pi r + (1 - \pi)s} = \frac{1}{2}$
- The strategy profile is $r = 1, s = \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}, q = 0, p = c$
- So, let's double-check sequential rationality:
  + When the state is $x$, $A$'s expected utility of recommending $X$ is $c$ (since $p = c$) and $A$ expected utility of recommending $Y$ is $-c$ (since $q = 0$), so that's fine
  + As we found in Step 1, since $p = c$, $A$ is indifferent when the state is $y$, so that also works
  + At the bottom information set, $q = 0$ is in fact optimal for $D$ when $\mu = 0$ since $1 > 0$
  + At the top information set, $D$ is indifferent as we worked out in Step 2 since $s = \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$, so $p = c$ is sequentially rational
